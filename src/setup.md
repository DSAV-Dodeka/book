# Setup

Here you can find information on how to set everything up, both the frontend, backend and database, so you can start developing right away.

If you are only doing things on the frontend, all you need to know is how to [setup the frontend](./setup/frontend.md).

If you are developing the backend, you will probably want to also test things on the frontend, but you will definitely need to setup first [the databases](./setup/docker.md) locally using a tool called Docker, and then you can [setup the backend application](./setup/backend.md) itself.
