# Overview

The technical information is divided into four parts:

- [**Setup**](./setup.md): which only teaches how to get everything running on your local machine, so you can dive into the code and start developing right away.
- [**Architecture**](./architecture.md): a deeper look at the architecture of the entire application, detailing why we made certain decisions and explaining things on a higher-level than you would find by looking at the comments and documentation in the source code.
- [**Developing**](./developing.md): details what kind of things you need to modify if you want to make changes. Contains tips on how to easily do actualy 'development', what files matter most, among other things. 
- [**Deployment**](./deployment.md): once you have developed something, it needs to actually go live. This section details all the steps you have to go through to deploy the code into the real world, how to administer the servers and related tasks.

Definitely look at Setup, and also at Deployment if you actually do an update. Otherwise, Developing should be what you look at next. Architecture is only necessary when you want to make big changes or understand things better.
