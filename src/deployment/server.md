# Server

Our server is hosted by Hetzner, a German cloud provider. Our server is an unmanaged Linux Ubuntu virtual machine (VM). VM means that we do not have a full system to ourselves, but share it with other Hetzner customers. We have access to a limited number of cores, memory and storage.

It is unmanaged because we have full control over the operating system. We need to keep it up to date ourselves. The choice for Ubuntu was also made by us. It has no GUI, only a command line, so getting familiar with the Unix command line is very helpful. By default, it uses the `bash` shell.
