# Frontend development

For more in-depth details on why certain decisions were made, see the [architecture section](../architecture/frontend.md).

The frontend development can be divided roughly into three sections:

- Updating the content (don't modify pages, just the text and images). See [here](./frontend/content.md). For information on images and how to optimize all images, see [here](./frontend/images.md).
- Adding new static pages (design-focused page design). See [here](./frontend/react.md).
- Creating dynamic pages (and integrating them with the backend). See the section in the backend [here](./backend/integrate_frontend.md).
