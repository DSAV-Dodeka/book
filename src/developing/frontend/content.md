# Content

The content can be found primarily in `./src/content`. There you can find many JSON files. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format that can easily be read by a machine. In the actual pages, we import these files and then read them, putting the text actually on the website. 

The images can be found in `./src/images`. Again, we import these images on pages using the `getUrl` function.
